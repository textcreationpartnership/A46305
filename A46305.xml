            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

About the end of July we had new aſſurance of this expedition, by the great number of Reform'd Officers and Gentlemen who engag'd themſelves dayly with Mr. <hi>Fueillade,</hi> and by the ſeverall young Lords whom the example of the Count of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> had drawn into the ſame enterprize.</p>
                  <p>Their Rendezvous was appointed at <hi>Lyons,</hi> where they who were under the pay of Mr. <hi>Fueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi> appear'd firſt, to the number of about 300. about the latter end of Auguſt; but by reaſon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Bravo's</hi> of the Town began to Troop together with the Soldiers of the Regiment of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and form parties againſt our Nobleſs, (which in other reſpects were in no great favour with the Towns-men) a new order was obtein'd to continue their march to <hi>Toulon,</hi> which was the place they were to embarque in. But there likewiſe they occaſion'd ſuch diſorders as coſt 3 of their Companions their lives: Which caus'd Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> to repair thither with all ſpeed to prevent the evil conſequences of that accident.</p>
                  <p>On the 8th of September he arrived there with Mr. <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and on the 10th to perfect the Rolls of ſuch as were in pay (which was 20 <hi>ſols per diem)</hi> he had a generall Muſter.

                     </hi> (who had had frequent affaires with thoſe Savages) told us that they had moſt of them the ſame at their ſeveral Caves, and that they never us'd them but upon ſome certaine deſign, which when they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, they drew them back again with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible agility, and addreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Being paſt a little way into this Den, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd light in ſeveral places towards the bottome, which made us beleive there were variety of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages by which thoſe Brutes might upon occaſion go forth to what part they pleaſed of the Iſle, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards the ſhore, where they lay their little Piquerons; all which was confirm'd to us by our experience ſooner then we deſired, for having diſcoverd a parcell of their hunted proviſions, which they had very cleanly diſpos'd upon a ſhelf hanging in the aire, in a very obſcure Corner, we took the boldnes to eaſe them of that care; and returning to the Skiffs again that brought us aſhore, very well pleas'd with our prize, we found our ſelves ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveſted with ſo great a number of that inraged kind of cattell, that they ſeem'd to ſpring out of all parts of the ſhore in a moment, and that which ſurpriz'd us moſt was that at the ſame time they were running after us with their <hi>Fuſils</hi> upon the ſhore, at the ſame time a great number of little boats, and wherryes advanc'd to intercept us at ſea:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63350:8"/> But by great happineſs thoſe who were ſent from our Ships for freſh proviſions, having diſcern'd the danger we were in, came immediately in to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and were fain to make uſe of all the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit their commerce gives them with that Nation, to get us out of their hands; which yet they could not obteine, 'till we had pay'd ſufficiently dear for what we had ſo unjuſtifiably ſtollen.</p>
                  <p>We left this Gulfe with a good gale of wind ſteering directly for <hi>Malta,</hi> where we arrived the 18th of October: ſo that we ſpent 25 dayes in making but 400 leagues, for they count it no more betwixt <hi>Toulon</hi> and this place.</p>
                  <p>We continued there 4 dayes, during which time Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> had ſeveral private Conferences with the <hi>Grand Maſter:</hi> it was immediatly beleiv'd it was to ſollicite him to ſend ſome releif too, and to perſwade him with us to attempt ſomething in favour of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the intereſt of the Church, that might be worthy of the honor of that Order.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort that very day we came aboard again, the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> call'd all his Knights together, and in a long harangue repreſented to them how much more it was their intereſt to aſſiſt the Town of <hi>Candy,</hi> than the <hi>French,</hi> who had no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation, but the common concernment of the Church. He added that it would be great diſhonour for them to doe nothing for their releif, neither in the Town nor upon their coaſts, and the <hi>French</hi> come ſo far with ſuch undaunted courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, to ſacrifice their lives in that place for the honor of their Religion, and the glory of their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63350:8"/> Prince; and at laſt deſired all ſuch as were diſpos'd to follow ſo Generous an Example to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: at which word all the <hi>French Knights</hi> of that Order cry'd out they were ready to go along, and that they attended nothing but his commands: There were ſome <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> who made the ſame proffer, but amongſt all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there was but one that preſented himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Master</hi> loves that nation very well, but he took ſuch diſpleaſure to obſerve it, that he could not contein himſelf from reproaching them upon the place; and nam'd 4 immediatly which he obliged to go along with the other, that it might not be ſayd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who are ſo much tickled and affected with being every where acknowledg'd the ſtricteſt and foremoſt of the Catholicks) ſhould indeed be the laſt in defending the intereſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Church, when they are ſo ſolemnly at ſtake.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Malta</hi> to <hi>Candia,</hi> is reckoned about 300 French leagues, which we made in leſs then 13 dayes, for on the laſt of <hi>October</hi> we found our ſelves in the entrance into the White Sea, betwixt <hi>Morea</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> which are not above 25 leagues aſunder, in which when we were a little advanc'd we diſcover'd before us two little Iſlands hard by one another, the biggeſt of which runs out towards <hi>Canea</hi> and is called the <hi>Cerigues,</hi> and the leſſer towards <hi>Morea,</hi> and is called little <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>We had ſome difficulty in paſſing theſe Iſles, by reaſon of a great number of Rocks interſperſed, but after having well conſider'd, we could not leave <hi>Cerigues</hi> to the leeward, without running up too
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63350:9"/> near to <hi>Canea,</hi> nor <hi>Cerigo</hi> to the other hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fetching too great a compaſs, which would be no leſs dangerous, ſeeing we muſt have coaſted upon <hi>Moria,</hi> the wind being gentle we reſolv'd to paſs amongſt the Rocks, which we effected at laſt with great trouble, but no prejudice at all.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of November we came into <hi>Standia,</hi> a little Iſle ſome 6 or 7 leagues from <hi>Candia,</hi> which is nothing but a long Mountain which ſhelters the Veſſels in its Harbor, and is the chief reaſon the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet lyes there.</p>
                  <p>This Iſle is inhabited by <hi>Greeks,</hi> but no leſs barbarous and rude, then the before mention'd Savages in <hi>Sardinia:</hi> They have no other Trade with Strangers, but for powder and bullet, of which they have particular need, their imployments and livelyhood, being nothing but hunting, which is very plentifull in that Iſle. The ſame day at 5 in the evening Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> put himſelf into a Gally (with Mr. <hi>de Fenelon</hi> and ſome other Voluntiers) which attended there to bring him to <hi>Candy,</hi> where as ſoon as he was arrived he went with Mr. <hi>Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſini,</hi> Captain General of the place, to veiw the works at <hi>S. Andree</hi> and <hi>Saboniera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond; Mr. <hi>de S. Paul</hi> enter'd into another Gally with the reſt of the Voluntiers and 50 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers of his Brigade, paſſing to the <hi>Foſſe,</hi> which is a place by the Sea about half a league from <hi>Candy,</hi> where they might come to an anchor. Being got thither, he left his Gally and went into a Barque, the Voluntiers, and the reſt of the Company did the ſame, in order to their landing at the Port of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata:</hi> As ſoon as they appear'd at the entrance of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63350:9"/> that Harbour, the Comte <hi>S. Paul</hi> was ſaluted by the Turks with five rounds of their Cannon, and they, which followed him receiv'd their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but all got in without any conſiderable damage.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Mr. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was landed, Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> went back immediatly to <hi>Standy,</hi> with reſolution to have landed all the reſt, the next morning: but about 9 or 10 the next day, there appearing 36 of the Turks Gallies (which pretended to land men too, gave an alarm to the Town, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment to the Turks, that they pretended they would have fallen on forth-with. But the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, which was at <hi>Standy,</hi> put to Sea with our 3 Shipps, and conſtrain'd the Turks to returne as they came. We thought to have landed in the Iſland, but being got already as far as the Trench, it was reſolv'd we ſhould take the benefit of the night, and put into <hi>Candy</hi> immediatly.</p>
                  <p>It was the 3 of Novem. that Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with his Troops before the port of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> and enter'd happily together into the Town.</p>
                  <p>There was only the Comte <hi>de Fountaine,</hi> Mr. <hi>de Fenelons</hi> ſons boat ſhot thorow and ſunk by three volleys of Cannon, which kill'd two men and took off both the leggs of a third.</p>
                  <p>All Mr. <hi>de Fenelons</hi> money and plate were in that boat which was ſunk, but was happily fiſht up again the next day by a Turkiſh ſlave, who had his liberty given him for his paines, and he is at preſent in the ſervice of Mr. <hi>de Fenelon</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

Of this number I was one, and having no leſs curioſity then the reſt, I thought it more for my inſtruction to go ſingly about it, and to ſatisfy my ſelf as particularly, and with as much order as was poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing I did, I went round the place, to take a view of the Fortifications, and began with the works of <hi>S. Andre</hi> and <hi>Saboniera,</hi> which lye at the two extremities of that ſide of the Town that runs along by the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Baſtion of S. <hi>Andre</hi> is the higheſt part of the Town on that ſide towards the Sea, and is not more then about forty paces diſtant from it; on the other towards the Ravelin of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> there are nothing but Rocks. The Baſtion of <hi>Saboniera</hi> has one ſide waſht with the Sea, and on the other (which is defended by the Fort of <hi>S.

There being no earth to be had to make their approaches: on the ſide they were capable of being attack'd, the Turks attempted not them there at firſt. They began with two of the inland Forts, <hi>Martiningo</hi> and <hi>Panigra,</hi> where by their frequent and deſperate aſſaults they had taken moſt of the outworks, eſpecially at <hi>Martiningo,</hi> which Fort they gain'd at length, and planted one their Colours, with the half Moon, upon it: But there being a <hi>Cavaliere.</hi> or mount ſtill left belonging

                  <p>Whilſt they were in ſuſpence of making good theſe two attaques, where they loſt the beſt of their men, a ſoldier run to them out of the Town, and adviſed them, that all their endeavours would be to no purpoſe, till they fell upon thoſe two Baſtions next the Sea, and by that means ſtopt up the mouths of both the Harbours, that of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> by their approaches at S. <hi>Andre,</hi> and that of the Mole, (or the Port of the Gallys) by their intrenchments at <hi>Sabionera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Turks were eaſily perſwaded; but becauſe they wanted earth to make their approaches on the ſides where the Baſtions were attackable, they quitted not their former Poſts, till they had brought a vaſt prodigious heap and thrown it betwixt the Fort of <hi>Panigra,</hi> and the Ravelin of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The <hi>Venetian</hi> perceiving it, imagin'd at firſt it had been to raiſe a platform in that place, and plant a battery to play into the Town: but their earth increaſing to ſo great a quantity, they were convinced it was in order to their approaches againſt S. <hi>Andre.</hi> A while after they ſaw all their forces drawn down on that ſide, and towards <hi>Sabionera,</hi> where earth being wanting as much as on the other, they were forc'd likewiſe to bring it a diſtance from the Mountain, by which means, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ortify'd with good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts, from whence they could fire upon us on all ſides within the ſhelter of their works.</p>
                  <p>To this they added that it was not in their power to afford us any relief in caſe of diſaſter, which was too likely to befal us, yea though we contrary to all probability ſhould beat off the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, yet all the ground we ſhould gain would be of no advantage, ſeeing they had neither men to make good, nor pioners to throw it down, and in a word that they wanted Souldiers much more then ground: By this it was cleer how uſeleſs this enterprize was eſteem'd by the <hi>Venetiaas,</hi> and how dangerous to the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally they left it to Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> and his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63350:24"/> Councel to conſider to what purpoſe it was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a handfull of Nobleſs, againſt ſuch a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous enemy, ſo well entrench'd, eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no expectation of relief.</p>
                  <p>By the great inſtances he made to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to engage themſelves in this ſally, 'tis manifeſt his reflexion was greater then uſuall, propoſing a way of effecting it, without ſo viſible a deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his men, and it was to fall upon the enemy on <hi>S. Andre</hi> ſide by the retrenchment of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> but Mr. <hi>S. Andre Monbrun</hi> oppos'd that immediatly, repreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nting that he had try'd that way himſelf with eight hundred men, and had left ſix hundred behind him, without doing any thing conſiderable for the advantage of the Town.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe diſcouragements could not alter the reſolutions of Mr. <hi>Fueillade,</hi> though againſt the judgements of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and all the Officers of the place, I will not give you his reaſons, for to ſpeak truth, I can ſee none; Perhaps the end of his expedition being to performe ſomething worthy of the Nobleſs he carry'd with him, he thought he could not in honor return without attempting ſomething extraordinary: But if he could not undertake any thing whilſt his force was entire, I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould doe it, when they were harraſt out, and reduc'd to a moiety of the number. It may be alſo he thought the action would be the more illuſtrious; and I doe not doubt but without any great violence to his inclination the gallantry and cheerfulnes of the young Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers which were with him, contributed much, amongſt whom the glory of ſo great an enterprize
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63350:24"/> does often take away the ſight of thoſe dangers that are otherwiſe too evident and conſpicuous.</p>
                  <p>But the greateſt part of thoſe who were not to bedaze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by the falſe luſture of an exploit ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently dangerous, were of opinion, it had bin better conduct to have manag'd the remainder of his forces to the benefit of the place he came on purpoſe to relieve. And to have attended further order from his Majeſty, who preſt him not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as he teſtify'd to him himſelf when he came back. This ſentiment was but juſt, yet when money begins to faile, and ſouldiers every day to be pay'd, one is glad to embrace any occaſion of acquitting himſelf without any ſtrict examination of the conſequences.</p>
                  <p>I am not certain whether Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> was in any ſuch exigency or not, this I know he deſir'd a young Noble-man of my acquaintance, to let him have two Bills of Exchange, which he had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. But that I may looſe no more time in making conjectures at the reaſons of ſo great a piece of gallantry, it is ſufficient you know the news was very acceptable to all our young Nobleſs, and that they expreſt very great joy when Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> aſſured them he was preparing all things for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſally, as they had often deſir'd: And on the fourteenth when orders were given out to all the Brigades to be ready the ſixteenth by break of day, they were ſo tranſported, it was eaſily vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> was not ſo much induc'd by reaſon to this enterprize as by a complyance and inclination to paſſion and precipitancy, to which he was as much addicted as the reſt of the young
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63350:25"/> Nobility were about to be ſacrificed.</p>
                  <p>However this reſolution appear'd irrational and deſperate to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> it is to be believ'd the vigour, and cheerfulnes wherewith our young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters prepar'd themſelves to execute it, gave them ſome hopes the ſucceſs might not be ſo fatal as was to be expected in reaſon; ſeeing General <hi>Moroſini</hi> gave them 100 men of the garriſon, which were diſpoſed into the ſeveral Brigades, and mounted ſeveral pieces of Canon on that ſide where the ſally was to be made, lining the wall with Muſqueteers and all ſorts of Granadoes, which did much increaſe the ſlaughter of the enemy, as I ſhall give you an account with as much exactueſs as can be performed by the eyes of one ſingle perſon.</p>
                  <p>Orders being given thorow our Brigades for a general aſſault on the 16 of <hi>December,</hi> at break of day, every one employ'd that evening in recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his conſcience, and in the night about two a clock they ſtood all to their armes at a rendevous appointed, where new orders were immediately given out for the ſally: Our four Brigades, and the 100 General <hi>Moroſini</hi> lent us, made up about 450 fighting men, beſides ſervants which march'd for the moſt part by their Maſters ſides, having each of them a pair of piſtols at their girdles, and a kind of half pike in their hands, with a long and very ſharp iron at the end of it, for their ſwords are but of little uſe againſt the Cymeters of the Turks, who fear nothing but our fire armes, which yet they manage with more dexterity then we, eſpecially their Muſquets, when they ſhoot from their works, or have leaſure to take their aime; for

                  <p>This Prieſt had a young Neice, came lately to live with him, of an excellent proportion, an amiable aire, and a certain ſweetneſs in her eye, that render'd her beauty (though otherwiſe not extraordinary) more greatfull and agreable, then the moſt exact.</p>
                  <p>She ſpeak Italian excellently well, but my skill in that language being but ſmall, I addreſt my ſelf principally to her Unkle, who loved French like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and having contracted a friendſhip with him, I did believe he would give me leave to wait upon her, and entertain her ſometimes at his houſe. But I had ſcarce began my propoſition to him, but with a deep ſigh he interrupted me, and told me, that the late misfortune of his Niece made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſome all conſequence or other, if ſhe ſhould accept that honor: Is it (ſayd I) that you imagine me ſo diſhonorable as to ſolicite ſo fair a Lady, (and ſo nearly related to a perſon for whom I have ſo great veneration) to any action of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal?
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63350:35"/> He reply'd, I take you Sir for too Noble a perſon, to deſign any ſuch thing: But it may be you are ignorant that my Niece is marryed to an Italian Officer, a cruel, treacherous, and violent man, who having bin forc'd to marry her after he had ſhamefully abus'd the ſimplicity of her youth, ceaſes not to retain an implacacle jealouſy of her, and a furious deſire of being reveng'd, the effects of which I cannot but fear, from his actions a while ſince to one of the braveſt Gentlemen among you.</p>
                  <p>His laſt words made me forget the reſentment his Nieces diſhonor began to excite in me; and to deſire to be inform'd who that Gentlemen was, and what that deplorable accident. Which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to me very civilly in this manner. A certain Cavalier of <hi>Normandy,</hi> called the <hi>Baron de S. Gille,</hi> a perſon of great ſtrength and courage, and one that was very eminent in <hi>France</hi> for his reſolute proſecutions of all kind of deſperate enterprizes, either good or bad, having attempted ſeveral times, (but in vain) to obtain from my Niece thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which the Law forbids, though Nature requires; at length he reſolv'd with the <hi>Chevalier de Tremes,</hi> after they had been in a debauch, to go and make her a viſit at her chamber, and to take ſuch a time as they might moſt probably find the Italian Officer within, upon whom they lookt but as a pretended husband, and one who kept her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for his divertiſement only.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly theſe two Cavaliers were as good as their words: They waited upon her in the evening, and found her husband with her, who ſeeing them enter, advanc'd to meet them, and to

Nor is it much to be admired, the ſtrictneſs of their Penances, and their aſſiduity at their prayers, imploying them day and night, and not expoſing them to thoſe temptations wherewith others are intangled.</p>

And this they have done ſeveral times as they judg'd it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: But the <hi>Greeks</hi> regarding the points of their diſcipline, and the antient practice of their Church, as inviolable precepts, have retain'd them as firmly, as their Articles of Faith.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two Churches have the ſame Sacraments, but they agree not in the forme of adminiſtration. The <hi>Greeks</hi> baptize with water like the <hi>Latins,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> have the ſame opinion of the reall preſence of <hi>Jeſus-Christ</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of the bread into his body, They adore the Hoſt as we doe upon their knees, and as it is removed from one place to another, they proſtrate themſelves like us: But the firſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt us is, they think it Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Another difference is, they give the Communion to the people in both kinds, following the antient practice of the Church, whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (believing <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be entirely in either) have thought fit to adminiſter it ſeperately, and upon conſideration of divers inconveniences, have chang'd that practice in their ordinary diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>They have another peculiar ceremony, and that is to conſecrate ſeveral Hoſtes upon <hi>Holy Thurſday,</hi> reſerving them apart to be communicated to thoſe that are ſick during that year.</p>

                  <p>Their faſting, and abſtinence from certain meats, much more auſtere then amongſt us; they obſerve all the antient faſts, that is they eat but once a day, towards the evening, and beſides their obſervation of Wedneſdays and Fridays throughout the year, they have four Lents, which the Layity keep with almoſt the ſame ſeverity as the Religious: The firſt is the ſame with ours, and laſts ſeven weeks. The ſecond begins the morning after the Octaves of the Pentecoſt.

                  <p>The Laiques doe not immitate the Prieſts and Monks, leſs ſtrictly in the aſſiduity of their prayers, then in the auſterity of their faſts. There is a great number of them, which recite the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary, as they doe, and on Sundays and Feſtivals, man, woman, and child fail not (without great neceſſity) to be preſent at Church from 2 a clock in the morning, ſinging of Hymnes till Sun riſing, after which time they retire till nine, and then meet again, to be preſent at Maſs: After dinner they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63350:41"/> much more exactneſs: moſt of the Prieſts and the people place their principal devotion in the worſhip of the <hi>Virgin Mary:</hi> They have no Muſique in their Churches: The women never ſit intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel'd with the men, but are plac'd apart where they can neither ſee nor be ſeen, but thorow a lettice. Preaching they uſe but very ſeldome; nay one of their Monks being accus'd of having preach'd in Lent, Eaſter, and Chriſtmas, was baniſh'd to Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> by the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their prayers for the Dead, their Invocation of Saints, their confidence not only in their prayers and interceſſions, but in their merit and aſſiſtance, their veneration for Reliques, and their worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Images, is the ſame with ours, with this ſmall difference only, they have no ſtatues, nor images emboſt in their Church, but in flat paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great ſtore, yet they doe not abſolutely reject them, for they are to be found ſometimes in the Chapels of their Canons.</p>
                  <p>And this is in few words what I could learn of the Doctrine, and diſcipline of the <hi>Greek Church:</hi> I ſuppoſe it is ſufficient to confirm you in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion you have always had of it, that unleſs it be in the queſtion about the Proceſſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the eſtate of Souls after the death of their bodys, and the Celibacy of their Prieſts, there is no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference betwixt that and ours: For which reaſon I ſhall return to my firſt ſubject, in which it remains, that I give you a ſhort accompt of the number of men in the Town, the diverſity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which they conſiſt, their ſeveral Poſts, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63350:41"/> which way they have ſubſiſted ſo long, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the <hi>Venetian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we came away, we left the Garriſon much weaken'd, as well as the Auxiſiary Troops: The number of Companys was large enough, but the Souldiers that compos'd them were very few: Some there were which had not above 4 or 5 men left; the reſt were generally not above a dozen or fifteen, and the fulleſt Company of all had not above 25. In ſo much as there were in a manner, as many Officers as Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>The Regiment of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which at firſt was 6000 men, was reduc'd to 2000. Yet all theſe relicts put together, amounted to near 7000 men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Inhabitants, which were about 4000, and all at the charge of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> as well as the Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>The force of the Garriſon is compos'd, of <hi>Greeks, Slavonians, Italians, Germans,</hi> ſome <hi>Swiſſes, Savoyards</hi> (which is their greateſt foreign force) <hi>French</hi> (moſt Officers) and Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> who alone have the Guard of the Breach of <hi>S.

The Towns men in all places, being oblig'd upon the leaſt alarm, to be in armes, and if after the beat of the Drum they be found without, they are ſhot immediately upon the place.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who underſtand nothing of the addreſs and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63350:42"/> policy of the <hi>Venetian</hi> doe wonder how they have been able to ſuſtein the charges of ſo redious a war, againſt ſo potent an enemy. And indeed to conſider the proviſion for that Garriſon, the Ships they are conſtrain'd to keep at Sea, the frequent levies they are forc'd to make, the recruits, the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, the Officers pay, the Convoys, and the quantity of Victuals they are conſtantly ſending, not for the Garriſon only, but the Inhabitants themſelves, both men, women and children, one would think ſo great a charge would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the treaſury of that <hi>Republique,</hi> and ruin'd its Citizens. For which reaſon I ſhall give you an accompt of their oeconomy, according to the beſt information I could gain.</p>
                  <p>You know very well already that the auxiliary forces, as the <hi>Popes,</hi> the <hi>Malteſes,</hi> the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> are no charge to that <hi>Republique,</hi> no more then the <hi>Germans</hi> and we were, when we were there; but it may be you doe not know that theſe ſupplys doe contribute to the ſubſiſtance of thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their pay, and that they have a cunning way of paying their Officers without money, and this is it I deſire you would underſtand.</p>
                  <p>The whole trade of <hi>Candy,</hi> and the reſt of the Iſles under the dominion of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> being manag'd to the advantage of that common wealth, under the direction of a <hi>Proveditor General,</hi> and the Inhabitants reſtrain'd from tranſporting, or ſelling their commoditys to any body elſe; it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily depend upon him to ſet what price he pleaſes upon ſuch proviſions as are brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding this policy of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> in paying their forces with Victuals: The Officers have had great reaſon to complain of the ſtopage of their money, for indeed they give them but little of that: which renders them all very poor and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable that ingage in their ſervice. For if it be true that want of money is the greateſt miſery a Soldier can ſuffer amongſt all the perplexitys of a Siege, 'tis moſt certain their condition in <hi>Candy,</hi> cannot but be extream, ſeeing they not only are always without money, but without hopes of any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, their Tickets being pay'd, without receiving a farthing. Upon which conſideration, amongſt all the Reformado Officers, that were with us, there was but one (how indigent ſoever they were) who would take imployment under them, except two more, which had ſcapt hanging very narrowly at <hi>Paris:</hi> True it is there were two or three of our moſt conſiderable Voluntiers, who for particular reaſons deſir'd to have ſtay'd: But Mr. <hi>S. Andre</hi> would by no means hear of it, but told them they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63350:43"/> would be counted fooles or mad men, by all that knew the condition of that place, if they perſiſted in that humour: In ſhort he acquainted Mr. <hi>Fueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade,</hi> who oblig'd them to go along, in ſpight of all their importunity to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The fourth of <hi>January</hi> we took our leaves of <hi>Candy,</hi> under the favour of a darkiſh evening, yet we could not doe it ſo privately, but the enemy diſcover'd it, though it was ſo late, we were got out of the reach of their Canon, before they began to give us their ſalvos, which they did very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, firing into all parts of the Harbour, out of which we paſt with our 3 Veſſels, the <hi>Duke</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, the <hi>Mermaid,</hi> and another, in which our wounded and ſick men were put, to the number of fifty or threeſcore.</p>
                  <p>By the way Sir I think it not amiſs to let you underſtand that in <hi>Candy,</hi> and almoſt quite thorow the <hi>Levant,</hi> they have a way of treating their ſick, very much different from ours, yet very convenient and of little expence; They ſuffer them to have neither fleſh, nor eggs, nor broths, nor ſyrrops, nor gelleys: The uſe of theſe things being obſerv'd to be mortally dangerous; for the whole nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they give them, is only a certain drink made of water and ſlices of bread crumbled into it, and boyld upon the fire, to ſuch a degree till the bread and the water be brought to a kind of a conſiſtance, which they call a <hi>Panade,</hi> which is to be taken as hot as broath: This liquour is indeed not over plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to be taken, nor proper to recover ones ſtrength, (for it is obſerv'd, all thoſe who take are on the other ſide very weake and feeble) but it carrys this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63350:43"/> advantage along with it, that the feaver being once gone, they need not above 3 or 4 days to recover their health and their fleſh.</p>
                  <p>We return'd by <hi>Standia,</hi> where we were at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor as we came. The weather being croſs we were forc'd to ſtay there to the 24, at which time our impatience made us reſolve to take the opportunity of a very ſtrong gale of wind, which however dangerous, might carry us with full ſayles a great way in a little time: But that wind blowing hard into the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>We were ſcarce out of ſight of thoſe Iſlands but were taken with a furious tempeſt, which diſperſt our 3 Ships: The Admiral wherin Mr. <hi>Fueillade</hi> was, was carry'd with great impetuoſity upon the coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> where he had been irrecoverably run on ground, had not one of the crew by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident diſcover'd Mount <hi>Gibel</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and (without knowing what Mountain it was) given

                  <p>He having not ſeen the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> when he was there before, by reaſon of a certain ſcruple he made to receive with the Title of Highneſs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aſſurance was given him that his Highneſs <hi>de Longueville</hi> his Brother, had given him the Principality of <hi>Neuchatel</hi> in <hi>Switzerland:</hi> But this difficulty was accommodated at his return by an ingenious expedient: It was contriv'd that Mr. <hi>S.

                  <p>M. <hi>Fueillade</hi> return'd him his thanks, accepted the kindneſs he proffer'd for the ſupply of his Fleet, and three or four dayes he ſtayd there to refreſh; But the minds of his party being at home, and the memory of their miſ-fortunes too heavy upon their hearts, they could not reliſh the civility they receiv'd there, nor be ſatisfi'd with any thing but the quickneſs of their return.</p>

But his Calamity being yet incompleat, it pleaſed God to afflict him once more, and to viſit one of his ſhips with ſo ſurious a plague, that it ſwept away moſt of them before they came a ſhoar; as if providence had been offended at his departure,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63350:49"/> and judg'd it ignoble and indecent for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſo pious an Enterprize with ſo many men.</p>
                  <p>Having brought the remainder of his forces to the Iſles of <hi>Yeres</hi> (which are certain ſmall <hi>Iſlands</hi> at no great diſtance from <hi>Toulon)</hi> he left them there till further Orders, himſelf haſting thither before: which being done, and ſuch quarters and accommodation as was neceſſary provided for them, they were Landed forthwith, and diſpos'd in ſuch manner as with leaſt prejudice to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, was moſt convenient for them.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before his affaires at <hi>Toulon</hi> were ſo well ſettled, there remain'd nothing for him to do, but to make his perſonal accompt to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> not only of his own Conduct and occurrences, but of the preſent poſture and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Town, which how couragious ſoever within, and ſupported with promiſes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, was notwithſtanding ſo preſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layd by the dayly ſupplys and advancements of the Turks, that without a more vigorous and ſpeedy aſſiſtance, there was but ſmall hopes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it long.</p>
                  <p>For the Turks had not only receiv'd conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable recruits, great quantity of Proviſions, and all the incouragement that ready money, and fair promiſes could give them, but they had lodg'd themſelves at the foot of the Baſtion of St. <hi>Andre,</hi> poſſeſt themſelves of the <hi>Pruili</hi> and <hi>Scotthere</hi> and rais'd ſuch platformes there as playd upon occaſion ſo Effectually into the Harbour of <hi>Tramatra,</hi> the Gallys could neither enter nor remain there but with great hazard and inſecurity.</p>

                  <p>Beſides the Grand Viſier upn the news of the Retirement of M. <hi>Fueillade,</hi> imagining he ſhould find the Town under ſome weakneſs or diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſolv'd upon a ſtorm; accordingly having drawn up 16000. of his men as privately in the night time as was poſſible, and divided them into two bodies, he fell on in two places with great cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and fury. Never did the Turks ſhow more courage then now: Never was the ſervice more deſperate on both ſides; The Viſier himſelf was aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, exhorting, encouraging, and threatning his men; the ladders were plac'd to the breaches, the Turks aſcended with their Fire-balls, Granadoes, and ſuch pernicious inſtruments of miſchief. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Turkiſh Creſſent was advanc'd by them, and immediately pull'd down again by the Town; ſometime they proceeded, and gained upon the place, when on a ſodain they were repell'd, and loſt what advantage they had gotten before, ſo that at the laſt obſerving their progreſs but ſmall, and the Garriſon invincibly pertenacious in defence of the Town, he ſounded a retreat, leaving the ground cover'd next morning with the dead, beſides what they buryed and carry'd off in the dark.</p>
                  <p>Neither was this the only Conſiderable aſſault or repulſe that did happen; not a week but ſome attempt or other was made upon it without, not a week but ſome Signal Exploit or other was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its defence within, and though in this and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other aſſaults he had loſt many thouſand of his men, and the wants and diſtreſſes of a Leaguer were not ſparingly amongſt them, yet having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

                  <p>Beſides all theſe advantages which the departure of the <hi>French,</hi> or his own aſſiduity had given him, he was quicken'd and excited by the noiſe of new Commotions at home: The Common people in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had a long time been ſencible of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>All theſe reaſons put together were enough to have invigorated a Complexion much more phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick then his; no wonder therefore if he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Zeal, renew'd his aſſaults, multiply'd his Mines, and preſſed with all poſſible importunity for recruits, which the Grand Segnior knew very well were but neceſſary, commanded ſeveral of his new rais'd men to be drawn down and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, but ſo great an impreſſion the terrour of that leaguer had made upon them, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd his Orders and diſbanded; in ſo much that he was Conſtrain'd to ſend ſix thouſand of the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> attending his perſon, and to Command ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his ſtanding forces in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> thither, for his reinforcement.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the Chriſtians leſs ſerious on their

                  <p>Nor was the deſign abſolutely ineffectual, though it took not to that degree it was hoped: General <hi>Moroſini</hi> took ſeveral Saichs and other ſmall veſſels intended for <hi>Canea,</hi> and forc'd the Grand Segnior to march moſt of his forces from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> and other ports (where they lay ready to be embark'd,) to <hi>Morea</hi> by land, to evade the danger of being taken by Sea, from whence by the connivance of the night, (it being not above ten hours ſayle) they could with more certainty and convenience convey them to the Grand Viſier.</p>
                  <p>This March, and the impediment the <hi>Venetian</hi> Galleys gave them by their daily appearance upon that ſhore, gave them no ſmall interruption in their progreſs before the Town, in ſo much that the Grand Segnior himſelf began to be impatient, and to upbraid the Viſier with his delay; But at length in ſpight of their watchfulneſs on bothſides, the Viſier had 7000. new rays'd men, and 2000. <hi>Janiſaries</hi> landed at <hi>Spinalonga,</hi> to the great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration and incouragement of his Camp: and General <hi>Moroſini</hi> return'd with 2000. freſh men, ſeventeen hundred barrels of Powder, and ſuch other recruits of money and proviſions as might encourage and enable them to hold out till they ſhould receive more conſiderable ſupplys.</p>

                  <p>And now the Alarm being taken on all hands, and the condition of that Town known all over Chriſtendom; it was not to be doubted but all Chriſtian Princes would be concern'd, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their aſſiſtance, according to their intereſt or affection.</p>
                  <p>His Holyneſs being Father of them all, and by conſequence moſt proper for ſo general a Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, by his Nuntios in <hi>Spain</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> he ſolicites very earneſtly for their aſſiſtance, he tells them the importance of the place, of what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Chriſtendom, not ſo much in reſpect of the native Commodities, or the convenience of the Port, as that it was as it were a ſtop and period to the Tyranny of the Turks; That the <hi>Venetian</hi> had hitherto maintain'd it at his own charge, though the benefit accrewed to them all: that after two years conteſt and reluctance, as it were upon their own bottom only, it was no wonder if they totter'd at laſt having ſo powerful and ſo wealthy an enemy to deal with; That it would have great reflection not only upon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, but the Religion of the Chriſtians, ſhould they ſit ſtill and ſuffer ſo ſerviceable a member to be cut off, without indeavouring by timely appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to repell the fury of the Gangreen. That the Turks had made a progreſs beyond what could have been imagined, had brought their mines into the middle of the Town, and with their plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms and Batteries, gon a great way in ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up the Harbours, yet the Town was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, nor their danger inſuperable; if their Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was great, it muſt be great Princes muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

                  <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> acknowledges the propoſal, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the condition of the Town, promiſes his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſome Land forces from <hi>Milan,</hi> and pretends, his aſſiſtance ſhould have been much greater, but that the King of <hi>France</hi> his late invaſion of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and his new pretences, kept them in ſo conſtant and chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an apprehenſion, that they could not ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally part with any more, unleſs they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves too groſly, and give him an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they might never recover, to which they ſuggeſted the minority of their Prince.</p>
                  <p>But the King of <hi>France</hi> to remove that objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and incline them to as vigorous an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Enterprize as himſelf, aſſur'd his Holineſs upon the Honor of a King, he would in no manner whatever diſturbe them for a twelve month, and as if he had fear'd his word alone would not have been taken by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he applys himſelf ſo ardently to the ſending of relief, that they might be certain he was not able to drive on two ſuch Enterprizes at once, neither his ſtock nor his time being ſufficient to bear it.</p>
                  <p>He acquainted his Holineſs with his Reſolution of ſending eight thouſand men under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke of <hi>Navailles,</hi> and that he would give orders to the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> (his Admiral at Sea) to prepare againſt <hi>May</hi> ſuch a number of his Galleys and men of War as ſhould be ſufficient
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63350:53"/> to tranſport and ſecure them; he deſired that his Holineſs would in the mean time make uſe of his paternal influence upon the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> that there would be neceſſity of intermediate ſupplys, to keep up their ſpirits and ſupport them till more came; That the Duke of <hi>Modena Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi> in reſpect of their ſcituation; and vicinity to the Sea were to be ſolicited for leveys, which in a ſhort time might be Embark'd, and at <hi>Candia</hi> before others on Ship-board: and that his Holineſs Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys (which he had intimated ſhould be ſent) might be ready at ſuch a Rendezvouz as ſhould be agreed on in the mean time.</p>
                  <p>And that his words and actions might correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond, and the World take notice and obſerve how little he conſidered the diſtance of the place, the dangers by the way, nor the difficulties there, when honor and Religion call'd ſo loud for his aſſiſtance, the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> is Commanded immediately to the Fleet to fit up ſuch a number of his Ships with all practicable diligence as he ſhould think Competent for the deſign.

                  <p>But all this being done, and all the art, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry uſed that might be expected from humane nature, could not ſtop the Carreer of the Turks; They had receiv'd vaſt ſupplys from <hi>Morea</hi> to re-inforce them, they had receiv'd vaſt ſums of money to encourage them, they abounded with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63350:62"/> all manner of proviſions for the ſound, and all ſort of Medicaments for the ſick; they were promis'd large Rewards if they carry'd the Town, and to have them doubled if ſpeedily: They knew it was impoſſible for any conſiderable relief to arrive that Winter, and therefore reſolv'd with all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and power to diſtreſs it in the interim: They had forc'd their way over the Graft, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd themſelves of the firſt Retrenchment, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd the ſecond, were Mining the third, and had ſcarce left them ground enough within for the throwing up a Fourth: They had on the other ſide with their Mines, and their Batterys, and their Granadoes, made the <hi>Sabionera,</hi> untenable, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd the Arſenal, ſhut up both the Harbours, and in ſhort reduc'd the whole Town to rubbiſh and duſt, in ſo much as it ſeem'd indefencible for the one, and uninhabitable for the other; and beſides all this the length of the ſiege, the Narrowneſs of their ground, the ſlaughter of their men, and the incommoditys they ſuffer'd for want of proviſions, had brought their men into ſuch a condition, they had not above 3600. left able to bear Armes, which was not ſufficient to doe the ordinary duty.</p>
                  <p>All theſe conſiderations being repreſented in a Councel of War, it was unanimouſly reſolv'd, they ſhould ſubmit to their fate, and give notice of their deſire to Treat, which being accordingly perform'd, and the propoſition receiv'd with great joy thorough the Viſiers Camp, Collonel <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardi,</hi> and Segnior <hi>Scordeli</hi> the Vice Chancellor were employ'd to manage it, and on the firſt of <hi>September</hi> ſent out on the ſide of the River <hi>Giofro,</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:63350:63"/> where the Grand Viſiers Quarters was, to meet with the Commiſſioners in the behalf of the Turks: But there was nothing Concluded that day more then that the conference ſhould be renew'd the next in the open Field in a large Tent, the Viſier would cauſe to be ſet up before the Fort of <hi>Dametrius,</hi> where they met and having continued the Treaty to the fift of <hi>September,</hi> at length the Articles were agreed upon and Hoſtages given on both ſides, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> Segnior <hi>Calbo</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of the Proviſions, <hi>de Riva</hi> Lieutenant of the Generals Guards, and <hi>Zaccaria Moccenigo;</hi> for the Turks, the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> of <hi>Temiſwar, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Baſſa,</hi> the <hi>Agi</hi> of the Janiſaries, and <hi>CaſſiBey,</hi> the <hi>Tefferdat</hi> of <hi>Romilia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Turks Hoſtages were ſent immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> into their Camp, where they were receiv'd by the Grand Viſier with great humanity, a rich apartement aſſigned them, a Guard of <hi>Janiſaries</hi> to attend them whither they pleas'd, and a Table of thirty diſhes a Meal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd them, to which was added the civility of ſeveral Viſits from the Viſier himſelf, and all the chief Officers of his Army.</p>
                  <p>The Articles agreed upon, and afterwards on the 19. of <hi>September</hi> ratify'd by the Senate, and the Grand Segnior, were theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the City of <hi>Candia</hi> ſhould be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred into the hands of the Grand Viſier, to injoy abſolutely, and freely diſpoſe of as a place belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Grand Segnior.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all Forts, and Principal Ports of the Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> with the Inſulets adjacent which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63350:63"/> are now in the Poſſeſſion of the moſt Serene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhall ſtill remain under the Obedience of the ſaid Republique, as they were before the beginning of the War.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That all the Iſlands in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and other Seas, that are in the Poſſeſſion of the moſt Serene Republique of <hi>Venice</hi> ſhall contiue as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the entire and abſolute Juriſdiction of the ſaid Republique.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Fort of <hi>Cleſſa,</hi> and all other places in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> conquer'd by the moſt Serene Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> from the Turks, ſhall remaine to the ſaid Republique, in ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and independant.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That neither of the two partys ſhall be bound or obliged to ſupply the other with any ſum of moneys, or any other thing whatſoever, under pretence of reimburſement of the Charge and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the War, or by way of penſion, preſent, or any other Title whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Grand Viſier permit, and grant the Captain General ſo much time as is Convenient and Neceſſary for the carrying all Ammunition, either for War or food out of the City of <hi>Candia:</hi> That he freely conſent that all Souldiers march out of the place with their Armes and Baggage. That he permit the Inhabitants who have no deſire to continue there, to retire with their Familys, Rings and Jewels, whither they pleaſe. That he conſent that the Captain General may carry away all the Republiques ſacred veſſels, and all Ornaments whatſoever belonging to their Churches.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That the Captain General may take out

                  </p>
                  <p>3. That the Priſoners and Slaves taken on both ſides during the Siege of <hi>Candia,</hi> be immediately reſtored, the Captain General and the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier iſſuing out their Orders requir'd for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Article.</p>
                  <p>9. That all theſe Articles agreed and faithfully Executed, both partys ſhall ſwear and promiſe to preſerve the Peace reciprocally and inviobably for the advantage of the Trade, and the mutual quiet of both their ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>On Friday the 27 of <hi>September,</hi> the forces were drawn out of the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> according to the ſaid Articles, and the Keys ſent the ſame day to the Viſier, who receiv'd them with much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, rewarding the perſon that brought them with a large ſum of money: having receiv'd them, he ſent immediately into the Town to cleanſe the Streets, and thoſe few houſes which were left, and to remove the dead bodys out of the Churches of St. <hi>Francis, St. Titus, St. Salvator,</hi> and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which he deſigned as <hi>Moſques</hi> for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the fourth of <hi>October</hi> the Town being cleans'd, and the Articles (to the immortal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Grand Viſier) punctually perform'd, he made his Solemn Entry into it at the Breach of St <hi>Andre,</hi> with his whole Army conſiſting of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 15000. Souldiers, and eleven thouſand pioneers, beſides his neceſſary attendants: he found the Town naked of all proviſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63350:64"/> there being left only two Greeks, three Jews, and eight more Strangers, whom the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier would have permitted to depart, but they choſe rather to change their Religion, then their Quarters, and continued there.</p>
                  <p>The Peace being Concluded and ratify'd in this manner, and the Town in the poſſeſſion of the Turks The; Generaliſſimo <hi>Moroſini,</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the conduct of the reſt of the Fleet, (which was then at <hi>Standia,)</hi> to the management or M.

                  <p>This done, the Generaliſſimo having certify'd the loſs of the Town, and the number of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants that had deſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63350:65"/> number was compleat, and no Vacancy at all.</p>
                  <p>And thus the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> that with ſo much honor for ſo many years had oppos'd it ſelf to the puiſſance of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, was at laſt (after three years continual Siege, after more Execution of men, and more Stratagems of War, then perhaps is legible in the Chronicle of any age,) forc'd to a ſerrender, but with this honor and apology, that it had ſlain and deſtroy'd near 100000. of their men, that it had given ſo long opportunity for their tumults, and confuſions at home, and though at laſt by their Mines under the Town, and their Granadoes playing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually into it, they were reduc'd to the greateſt neceſſity imaginable, yet could not they be forc'd to diſhonorable conditions, or perſwaded to doe any thing at laſt incongruous with the bravery of their Comportment during the whole Siege.</p>
